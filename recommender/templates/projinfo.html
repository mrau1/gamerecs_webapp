      Recommendation systems are a popular and profitable application of machine learning across many forms of media.  There are no available, user-centric recommendation algorithms that draw data from multiple sources. By creating a video game recommendation system we hope to help users discover games they would not have otherwise. Modern recommenders rely on corporate advertising motivations or private user data. The creation and obtainment of video games require more time and financial investment than other media such as film, music, etc. Twitchâ€™s Internet Games Database is a comprehensive dataset and API, similar in function to the IMDB. We aim to use this data to leverage user opinions on popular games to recommend indie games.

We did think it best to start with a KNN algorithm, but we wouldn't begin developmemnt on this until much later. For now our focus was learning and planning, creating a loose timeline and organizing our ideas and time.</td>

This was difficult at first, as we wanted specifically user and game interactions as our data. A simple average score combined with the number of reviews would not be substantial. We eventually wanted to create user profiles populated by their input games. To get data similar to this we would need individual ratings by separate users.</td>

Matt and Kelly headlined this effort, making substantial progress on the code. By the end of this milestone we had a working KNN implementation ready for testing and training.</td>
