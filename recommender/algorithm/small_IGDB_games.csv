Due to its rarity (the back insert states the print run was of 2,500 copies), the game has become a prized collector item.

The actual game consists of a few select levels from Donkey Kong Country with the addition of a point counter and a few minor tweaks to encourage scoring, the goal being to score as many points as possible. The tree house and banana cave at the start of Jungle Hijinxs have been disabled and all of the animal tokens in the early levels have been replaced with banana bunches, making it impossible to reach the bonus round without the usage of a cheating device.

In order to save himself, Lupine must get hold of Sokai's treasure (it is said that there is a cure in the treasure that could heal from the dark blow), through a series of clues written in the Book, aka the Pink Crystals (accompanied by the Black Crystals in the second narrative strand of the game), which however are the prize up for the winner of the Miss Sokai competition. Fujiko signs up for the beauty contest, but a problem arises: it is the beautiful Ginrei, a girl so charming that she even arouses admiration of the impassive Goemon. As if this were not enough, the inspector Koichi Zenigata, bitter enemy of Lupine III, senses that the next target of the protagonist will be the Pink Crystals and then rushes to Ginrei to warn her about Lupine and to supervise her in order to keep her safe . The first encounter between Zenigata and Ginrei is not the best: she invites him to leave her alone because the young woman is convinced that she is out of any danger, while he considers her a vain girl and dad's daughter (not knowing that in reality the young it comes from the outskirts of Sokai, a very unreliable and above all very poor neighborhood). 
 
Lupine, meanwhile, fearing that Ginrei could steal the title of winner from Fujiko, plans to sneak into the girl's hotel to secretly give her a dose of sleeping pill that will make her sleep for two days. But since Zenigata was there to guard the girl, the gentleman thief was tracked down twice (first in the restaurant where Zazzà and the girl had dinner, then in the young girl's apartment after Lupine had managed to escape all the policemen who were patrol), but both times he quickly manages to escape. In the meantime, the relationship between Ginrei and Zenigata is notably changing: between the two an agreement begins to arise, Zazà no longer thinks that the young woman is only a presumptuous egoist, while the latter sees in the inspector a figure that protects her and who is always present next to her in times of need. In other words, the spark of love began to ignite. 
 
The day of Miko's competition arrives: Fujiko and Ginrei parade on the catwalk with elegance and, above all, unparalleled seduction. But between the two it is Fujiko to tick it, undoubtedly more loose and sexy than the opponent, decidedly more shy and reserved. Armed then with pink crystals and the blessed Miko (Fujiko), Lupine and the woman hurry to reach the Government Palace of Sokai where the treasure is said to be hidden. The protagonist escapes all the traps and deadly traps hidden by the building; Meanwhile Zenigata tries to improvise a speech to herself to console Ginrei, when suddenly she feels that she is talking to Kourin, the architect of the Dark Strike who sentenced Lupine to only three days of life. Zazzà discovers that Kourin is none other than Ginrei's brother, who wanted his sweet sister to win Miko's contest in order to obtain the Pink Crystals that will lead the terrible boy to Sokai's treasure. The inspector bursts into the room where Kourin and Ginrei are conversing, but the boss of the Celestial Dragon treacherously shoots the poor Zenigata, who fortunately manages to save himself thanks to the bulletproof vest he had worn to protect, if necessary, Ginrei. Kourin thus rushes to the Government Palace to prevent Lupine from taking possession of the treasure; the head of the celestial dragon reaches Fujiko and the protagonist, and informs the latter of the fact that the medicine capable of healing him from the Dark Strike is the so-called Fog Flower, a flower, in fact, capable of totally eliminating the effects of the terrible kill shot. To prevent the thief from continuing further, however, Kourin strikes Fujiko with the tremendous Dark Strike, unleashing the wrath of Lupine who, furious as ever, kills the boss of the Celestial Dragon gang through the blows of his infallible Walther P38 (in the second the final of the saga, instead is Zenigata to finish Kourin, to avenge the sufferings that the latter caused to his sister Ginrei). 
 
Lupine thus manages to take over the flower of fog, making Fujiko drink the only purifying drop, which recovers and can barely see the smiling face of the thief, who falls apparently lifeless to the ground. Fortunately, the woman kisses the protagonist to thank him for saving her life,","Lupin Sansei: Lupin ni wa Shi o, Zenigata ni wa Koi o is an Action game, developed by Nex Entertainment and published by Banpresto, which was released in Japan in 2007.",[38324],[146453],,,,[1],[31],[2],,,[1],,,[37297],4155,,,3,,[898],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Even if it could be stopped, what hope is there when inexplicably, no one can remember a thing? Tonight, step into Betty’s shoes and find out exactly what happens at ‘3 Minutes to Midnight’.” 
Imagine, if you will, being woken in the middle of the night by a deafening sound and the entire house shaking to its core. A scary enough thought in its own, wouldn’t you say? But what if you then realized you had no idea what year it was, where, or even who you were? Well, that’s the stuff of nightmares… 
 
Unfortunately, if you hadn’t already guessed, this isn’t just some bad dream that you can shake off and drift lazily back to sleep. No, this is your heart sinking, gut wrenching, terrifying new reality. 
 
A young lady, Betty Anderson, alone in the world and a stranger in her own mind, it now rests on your narrow shoulders to figure out what’s happening. Any thoughts you may harbor about running away, well, since you don’t even know where you are, where would you run to. Hmm? 
 
Instead, let’s presume you’re made of sterner stuff and begin searching for an explanation. Maybe someone nearby will give you the answers you seek or even go far as to offer some insight of their own. Either way, you can only hope that whatever caused the ringing in your ears is the only thing that goes bump in the night… 
 
Let’s be honest though, that’s not how these things tend to pan out, is it?","3 Minutes to Midnight is Scarecrow Studio ’s first adventure game with its development led by Jan Serra It is a classic point-and-click adventure game telling the story of Betty Anderson.

It's hard to discover what makes rolling those dice over and over again so fun, but it's beyond delight when you finally see those sixes line up. 

Yatzy is a simple brain game that trains analytical thinking. It's a classic dice game.

The objective of Yatzy is to score the highest possible score within the 13 rounds of the game. Players roll five dice in order to make the desired combinations, which have different fixed or variable point values. The results of each turn are recorded on a special score sheet.

Yatzy is played with five dice. This popular game, lasts for 13 rounds as the players roll the dice and attempt to complete various combinations. The rules of yatzy are simple, and the game remains popular among people of all ages. Simply roll the dice, make your choices and score some points. At the end of the 13 turns, the player with the highest point total wins the game

Do the best dice combination in the this multiplayer Yatzy game. Half of the fun of this game is to yell out the game's name if and when you roll one. A Yahtzee occurs when a player rolls and all five dice are the same number. Rolling five ""sixes"" is the best roll in the game. 

Special Yatzy rule is, the first time you get a yatzy in a game it is worth 50 points (if you use it in the yatzy slot). If you roll another yahtzee after you have already got the 50 points (i.e., you didn’t take a zero), you will get a 100 point bonus.

The Yatzy scorecard contains 13 scoring boxes divided between two sections: 
1) Upper section 
2) Lower section

It is a game of great chance, luck and also of smart thinking and strategy. If you are a Yatzy addict then this is the best game for you.

Download and play Yatzy and enjoy all the fun strategy elements that come along with this classic dice game.

A nefarious supervillain named ""Doctor Maybe"" (a pun on the name of Dr Julius No, the villain in Dr. No) has overtaken the ruthless megacorporation Acme Oil Co, and is not only filling the oceans with radiation and toxic waste but even threatening all the world from his underwater lair. The protagonist of the story and player character of the game is an intelligent, mutated anthropomorphic mudskipper who is given the name ""James Pond"" (after the legendary spy James Bond) and hired by the British Secret Service to protect the seas and take out the bad guys in underwater areas. He is also suave enough to seduce numerous attractive mermaids, some of whom act as double agents as is common with James Bond's love interests. The game spoofs James Bond movies with levels mimicking their titles, with level names like ""License to Bubble"" (after Licence to Kill), ""A View to a Spill"" (after A View to a Kill), ""Leak and Let Die"" (after Live and Let Die) and ""From Three Mile Island with Love"" (after From Russia with Love).",,[11396],,,,[1],[8],[4],,,[1],,,,692,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Those who aren't afraid of the words 'financial planning' can take pleasure in making great deals and expanding their business by choosing the path of a merchant and a business man. Rank and wealth can be achieved any way you like.

The aim is to solve a real-time packing problem by forming complete rows, which then disappear and score points. Poor play leads to incomplete rows, caused by inefficient arrangements of tiles; these rows do not disappear, giving the player progressively less space and less time to play subsequent pieces.

The series' trademark isometric combat returns, now presented in 3-D with 3-D character models. Players attempt to position themselves tactically to gain an advantage over stronger (or more numerous) foes. Combat takes place in turns, with each side moving one character per turn. Each party member can carry two weapons and switch between them without using up a ""turn,"" allowing them to shift quickly from a sword to a long-range bow, for example. Characters gain levels through successful battles, and increase skills with a particular weapon or spell by using that weapon or spell in combat. 
 
Many engagements expand beyond simple combat by introducing some sort of puzzle element, ranging from pushing boulders to protecting characters from attackers. Missions may also radically update their goals as progress is made. In addition to the standard game, there are also multiple endings and multiple ""secret maps"" unlocked across the regular levels.",,[130084],[49601],,,[1],"[12, 16, 24]",,,,,,,,919,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The object of the game is to try to hit Vector Strong Bad's head until it disappears. The game's graphical style appears to be a reference to Nintendo's ill-fated 3D system, the Virtual Boy.

The recently completed Keel Nuclear Power Plant has been taken over, and S-SWAT are tasked with handling the situation. Except as Lila (now promoted to Lieutenant) points out in the intro, why send in the Supernatural SWAT squad to deal with common terrorists? As the Chief reveals, they've found strange creatures in sewers - creatures not of this world, but from Hades (the other dimension in the first game), meaning whoever was behind the previous crisis is behind this one. What survivors remain are barricading themselves indoors. The city has been cordoned off and Lila is the prime candidate for the mission. So off she sets, with four fellow S-SWAT members, to regain control. 
 
This sequel has undergone radical changes from the original, with all of the RPG trappings stripped out. There's no longer any kind of stats, menu system to navigate, day/night cycle, overworld map, or weapon recovery items. In fact the only items are drugs, which restore health to maximum and only one can be carried at a time, and key items with further the story. The biggest (and arguably best) change is the combat: there are no longer any random battles. Taking place on a series of massively sprawling maps, as opposed to shrunken JRPG-style maps which warp you to new maps when entering buildings, all enemies can be seen immediately. Furthermore you never fight more than a single enemy at a time. If there's something hostile in a new area, you can see his health bar at the bottom. 
 
In a lot of ways it closely resembles the original Metal Gear, except more sedate and with greater emphasis on NPC dialogue.",,,,,,,[31],,,,[1],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

My name is Yusima, a former Japanese detective. Being a detective in Japan is relatively easy. There is no exam and there are no strict trials you must go through. There is no strict approval process also. Detectives are very much like ordinary people. They don't have any special authority for investigations per say. So for example, when a detective ask someone about something or they ask for a survey or when they are on a stakeout, they may be mistaken as a stalker or suspicious person. This means they might be reported to the police. Since this is the case, Japanese detectives should be quick on their feet and should be able to lie and make good excuses on the spot.
I was originally a good person who was very bad at lying, but during my detective work over the past 10 years, I had become a good liar and deceiver.

They tried to close the case, but her husband wasn't convinced. He didn't want to believe his wife was a monster. He decided to ask a detective to investigate the case, that's why Kouya is now roaming around deep inside the forest.

It is getting dark, but he doesn't know where he is now. Just when he feels dizzy, he hears someone's voice. Is that auditory hallucination? He hears a girl's voice this time. ""I've been saved!"" But he accidentally falls down a waterfall. When he regains his consciousness, he finds himself lying in the bed. He looks around and finds three girls. ""Are you alright?"" ""Well, did you save me?"" ""Yes, I and my older sister carried you all the way here."" Their mother says to him, ""I'm relieved to see you getting well. But you must marry either of my daughters, Sunao or Hiori.""

He doesn't know what she means. A mysterious hand bitten off by someone, a small village deep inside the forest, marriage to a miko, Kouya's fate is led to unexpected direction after he meets these two girls...",,,,,,,,[34],,,,,,,[64925],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

And when it turns out that the island is not completely uninhabited, save the future friend and comrade-in-arms (Friday, who, by the way, has yet to learn Russian) and try to flee by building a balloon out of improvised means and outwitting the pirates. And the fate of the poor fellow Robinson depends on the acumen of the player.

Very little of the manor has survived the holocaust ignited when the Detective disabled Charles Dalimar's immortality machine, but Emma Ravenhearst's ghost appears to him, warning him away, but promising to help if he proceeds.
After inspecting the ruins as far as a nearby lighthouse and the back garden, the Master Detective is flung into an open grave bearing his (or her) own name by Victor Dalimar. After encountering Charles, the Master Detective sets to work on a steampunk recreation of scenes in Charles' insane life, which the Detective must now relive by solving one puzzle after another. Arriving in an underground antechamber, the Master Detective must watch as the four souls previously rescued from the manor: Emma, Rose Somerset, and her twin daughters Charlotte and Gwendolyn are re-imprisoned, and restored to living humans as each scene opens. The Detective must participate in recreating Charles's birth, abusive childhood, time of commitment to a mental institution, and the wedding he planned for himself and Emma.
Once the Detective has traveled through Charles's world, the final door opens (via Emma's chamber) to reveal a rudimentary mansion with a new immortality machine, powered by the life-forces of the kidnapped citizens of Blackpool. Sneaking past a jubilant Charles and Victor, the Master Detective deciphers clues from the enslaved prisoners to figure out how to shut down the machine, freeing Emma, Rose, Gwendolyn, and Charlotte and destroying the Dalimars once and for all.",Mystery Case Files: Escape from Ravenhearst is an adventure-puzzle casual game developed by Big Fish Studios and distributed by Big Fish Games.

On each static screen, the player is free to look around 360o. The game's interface is very simple; there is no HUD, instead the player has access to an inventory in which all items are stored. From the inventory, the player can also access objectives, review dialogue and examine any documents they have acquired.[9] 
 
To speak to people or interact with objects, the player must click on them with the pointer. As the player moves the pointer around the screen it can change to an arrow (meaning the player can move in that direction), a magnifying glass (meaning the player can inspect something in more detail), a cog with a red line through it (meaning the player must use an item on the object), a cog without a red line (meaning the player can operate the object without using an item) or a hand (meaning the player can pick the item up). When the player clicks on a person to whom they wish to speak, a list of conversation topics appear on screen. When the player picks up an item, it is automatically put into an auto-holder rather than the main inventory, and must be transferred manually from the auto-holder to the inventory screen. This allows the player to sort the inventory in any way they wish.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It was released on November 19, 2007 for the Xbox 360, PlayStation 2 and PlayStation 3. 
 
The cover features Greg Oden, formerly of the Ohio State Buckeyes. 
 
Almost every school competing in Division I NCAA college basketball at the time was included in 2K8, including recent additions South Carolina-Upstate, Cal State-Bakersfield and Florida Gulf Coast. Not included were Presbyterian College and North Carolina Central, D-1 independents. Also, Centenary College of the Summit League was unlicensed and instead named UL-Calcutta. The game also featured the ability to change and modify rosters and share them online via the newly introduced 2K Share feature. The real coaches feature was dropped from this game, possibly because the coaches chose not to renew their contracts and all of the coaches are unnamed. 
 
The announcers/commentators featured in the game were Verne Lundquist and Bill Raftery. The College Hoops series was put on hiatus in 2008 as 2K Sports declined to seek the college license for a 2K9 release. EA Sports got the contract before 2K did, so EA will continue to make college basketball games. EA discontinued their college basketball game series in 2010. It is currently unknown if 2K Sports will continue to make their College Hoops 2K series.",,,,,,,[14],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tranquil moments will offer story bits from the fox, while mundane and strange wildlife present unique and unknown obstacles on the journey toward liberation.

You search a massive persistent open world in search of food, drink, and shelter.
The game has a realistic, complex, yet intuitive crafting and skill system. Crafting in Vantage is heavily researched to be as realistically accurate as possible. For example: to create a primitive fire you must first create a wooden spindle and hearth, as well as find some tinder (dry grass for example). Then with these items you attempt to create a fire using the ""hand drill"" method. Crafting uses time and energy, as well as many skills which make your crafting easier. If your crafting skills are to low then you may fail at your professions until you work to get better at them.
You can brave the large world alone, or with friends online! Create your own village, or even an entire town with your friends. You can also gather your friends to go hunting for animals. You can go spear-fishing, take out rabbits with your sling, or go for bigger prey like Sabertooth Tigers. And if you are up to the challenge, you can get a group of friends together into a hunting party and you can try your hand at hunting mammoths! Be careful though, the bigger the animals, the more dangerous they are!","Vantage is a Primitive Survival Game. Your main objective is simple... to stay alive!

The game takes place in a fictional alternate reality where countries have access to highly advanced magitechnology. In the process of creating monsters with this technology using an ancient creature named ""The Gods of Magic""; it broke free of its bonds and took control of the secret facility and proceeded to slay all of the research team and arm the compounds defenses. The player is a commander in charge of the Cyborg Enforcer Teams sent into the dungeon to reclaim it. The game featured 100 levels of randomly generated maps, the first ten being the games main story mode. The other 90 were extended play for players wanting to continue playing with their strong characters. 
 
Game play[edit] 
As the game starts, you create a team of Enforcers for your expeditions into the dungeon, with the option to create over 40 total. When creating your characters you are given the ability to alter height, sex, ethnicity, weight and hair style as well as given a choice between the Fencer, Caster, Analyzer, Striker, or Broader classes; Each falling into a Dungeons and Dragons styled role. Several Advanced classes were available by finding Class Chips in the dungeon and applying them to your characters. Once inside the dungeon, the players team must move around, find monsters and equipment while leveling up. A major point unsaid in game is that you are not expected to be able to beat a level's boss on the first time entering the level; as you could only allocate level up points while out of the dungeon. 
 
Dungeons were randomly generated, most adhering to a typical design that made the map seem less random then it was. Each level has a control room that could possibly be locked, holding a boss monster that must be defeated to win the level and unlock the next one. 
 
Fencer Fighter class that could use Hammers or Swords and had the rare chance of performing a move like a Final Fantasy ""Limit Break"" that would damage all enemies at once. 
 
Analyzer Ranged class. Without an Analyzer in the party, the player is unable to know how much health enemies have and their current HP amount. Analyzers used firearms ranging from laser beams, to machine guns, to rocket launchers that all shared the same in game model. 
 
Caster Basic Spell Caster that could be wired with a variety of Spell Chips either bought from the in-game shop or found in the dungeon. Each spell had a number of charges that had to be refilled by visiting the surface. Casters automatically blocked until the player told them what spell to use. 
 
Broader The Jack-Of-All-Trades class that had a flat rate for all skill gains at the expense of leveling up extremely slowly and was reserved for advanced players that foresaw spending a large time grinding. 
 
Striker A barbarian class that used combat gloves as their weapon. Each strike had a rare chance of instantly killing a non-boss enemy. 
 
Reception[edit] 
Metal Dungeon was rated very poorly for its simple game play, transparent story, and character creation system. The game's setting turned it into a cult classic near instantly for its magic-punk stylized world.

The game is designed to challenge the player in such a way where they adapt their own style and platforming skills; no two players will play through each zone the same way. With a limitless combination of movement options and paths through a zone, there will always be a way to clear a zone faster. Compete with your friends and the world as you climb from just barely scraping through each zone in the first play through to smashing each zone in under thirty seconds. 
 
Movement is very expressive. As a player gains more experience and unlocks new abilities, they'll create their own style. One player might prefer running up a wall, while another would swing around it, while another would jump up it. 
 
There's also much more to do besides clearing zones with a surprise waiting for any player skilled enough to complete a play through.","There's always room for improvement.

Released on March 18, 2003, the Rainbow Six video game series is based on Tom Clancy's best-selling novel of the same name. 
 
Based on the Unreal Engine 2.0, Raven Shield is a tactical shooter with realistic properties. Raven Shield moved toward mainstream first-person shooters like Counter-Strike, adapting various features absent in previous versions. These included the ability to see one's weapon while in first-person view, many new weapons and upgrades (including larger magazines and sights), and a redesigned multiplayer. 
 
A console version, entitled Rainbow Six 3, was developed for the Xbox, PlayStation 2, and Nintendo GameCube. This iteration of the game features the same basic engine, models, textures, and artwork, but with significantly different game mechanics, gameplay, and storyline. A port was also released on Mac OS X on December 19, 2003. Due to the console version's success on the Xbox and the popularity of its subscription-based online multiplayer service, Xbox Live, an Xbox-exclusive semi-sequel was released in 2004 titled Rainbow Six 3: Black Arrow. The next full game in the Rainbow Six series, Rainbow Six: Lockdown, was released in 2005.",,,,,,,[5],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Their sun is going supernova, and they need your help to build up their city and find a way to escape the impending solar disaster!

Ever dreamed of creating your dream house in an out-of-this-world setting? In Spacefolk City citizens inhabit a solar system where the sun is close to going supernova and it is up to you to create a city for all of those who are fleeing their homes!

Solar flares and other dangerous activities have resulted in the destruction of Spacefolk settlements around the system, leaving many Spacefolk without a home. Stranded citizens are brought to your new settlement and you must help them build a new city and eventually construct a solution to allow everyone to escape the danger of their dying sun.

But hey, that doesn’t mean it has to be a boring job!

The Spacefolk are lovely citizens and all want to have a good time. They have different backstories and talents, and they’d love to contribute to your efforts of making a new home for them. It’s up to you to create a spacious space… in outer space!

Spacefolk all have interests that are indicated by their body type. By building homes and facilities that are decorated with items matching Folks’ Interests, you can make them happy. Happy Folks perform their roles around the city more efficiently, and can also make use of special abilities unique to each species.

Each Spacefolk has different abilities that you’ll need to utilize creatively to ensure their survival. Spruce up the place with items matching each of their interests to keep them happy, and maximize their roles around the city to create a delightful little community!

Why limit your city building to a flat surface! Enjoy the spatial advantages of VR and construct your city in free-space, adding buildings on top and underneath. Be sure to make the most of all the silly things you can decorate your city with too, so your Folk remain happy and productive. Cooperate with your Folk and work your way toward a solution to their solar crisis!","Spacefolk City is a funky, casual take on the city building genre.

As you hunt for your lost little brother, Delbert, you must enter a house full of zombies, spooks, and bad guys and turn them into hamburger meat, before they make a meal out of you in Dangerous Dave in the Haunted Mansion! 
 
Dangerous Dave’s Risky Rescue 
Unfortunately for our hero, his little brother is afflicted with “always getting kidnapped” syndrome. Dangerous Dave must battle wolves, mummies, ghosts, and other ghastly apparitions on his way to save Delbert from the clutches of the evil Dr. Nemesis. With 11 levels of spine-tingling platforming action, you’ll be shooting up a storm in Dangerous Dave’s Risky Rescue! 
 
Dave Goez Nutz! 
Life is difficult enough without having Dr. Nemesis as your arch-villain. Why does he have to pick on Dave’s little brother, Delbert, so much? Not only does he snatch the already kidnapping-prone Delbert, but he hides him away deep in the bowel of an insane asylum! Crazy nurses wearing purple of all colors wander the halls, cleaver wielding orderlies, and jolts of electricity all stand in Dangerous Dave’s way in Dave Goez Nutz! 
The Dangerous Dave Pack includes Dangerous Dave in the Haunted Mansion, Dangerous Dave’s Risky Rescue, Dave Goez Nutz! and The Deserted Pirate's Hangout!

Dawn of War: 
Ten thousand years have passed since the treasonous acts of Chaos toppled the Golden Age of mankind. Fires burn brightly throughout the galaxies, illuminating carnage and slaughter as mankind defends itself from ancient enemies. Hardened forces collide with one goal in mind, the complete extermination of their opposition. Control one of four unique races in head-to-head or cooperative multiplayer action, where faith, skill, and strategy are requisites in ruling the universes. 
 
Winter Assault: 
The expansion pack to the award winning Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War will build upon the most exciting, visceral, front-line battlefield ever seen in an RTS game. Lost amongst the ruins of a leveled city lies an Emperor Class Titan, a war vessel of untold power forged in the planet-wide furnaces of Mars, and revered by billions as the epitome of Imperial dominance. The one who controls it will command the power to destroy, or defend, a world. The Imperials will summon it to overcome great evil, Chaos will corrupt it for their own designs, Orks will destroy it in their bloodlust and Eldar will disregard it in their arrogance. 
 
Dark Crusade: 
Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War - Dark Crusade will feature two new playable races, the Tau Empire and the Necrons, bringing the number of totally unique races to an unprecedented seven. In addition to the two new playable races, Dark Crusade will feature an all-new single player campaign centering on the conquest of a ""meta-map,"" with each territory captured giving tangible rewards to the occupying force. A greatly expanded multiplayer component and a completely unique economy model for the Necrons will present gamers with the most compelling Dawn of War game to-date.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They are spent by finding the appropriate teacher. Several skills have only one ""level"" (Sneaking, Acrobatics), while the fighting skills (one-handed weapons, two-handed weapons, bows and crossbows) have two proficiency levels. If the Hero chooses to be a Mage (or joins the Swamp Camp), he will be able to learn Circles of Magic; of which there are 6. The main attributes are increased in 1 or 5 point increments, starting at 10 and capping off at 100. The cap can be surpassed with the use of potions.

The game places a special focus on the interactivity of the environment. For example, hunting wild animals can earn the player raw meat. This heals damage and can be sold. However, by using a stove or frying pan, the player may also choose to turn this into grilled meat, which heals much more effectively. Similarly, most of the activities other characters can be seen doing (playing musical instruments, stirring soup pots, urinating etc.) can be done by the main character as well (although with the exception of forging weapons these activities have little bearing on the game).

The player can choose which camp to join, although quests get increasingly linear and the distinctions between different factions wane in the latter parts of the game. The major difference is that Swamp Camp members cannot become mages, because they are limited to 4 magic circles (out of 6). However, they gain access to magic earlier.","Gothic is a single-player action role-playing video game for Windows developed by the German company Piranha Bytes. It was first released in Germany on March 15, 2001, followed by the English North American release eight months later on November 23, 2001, and the Polish release on March 28, 2002.

Gothic has been well received by critics, scoring an average of 80% and 81/100 on Game Rankings' and Metacritic's aggregates, respectively. Reviewers credited the game for its story, complex interaction with other in-game characters, and graphics, but criticized it for the difficult control scheme and high system requirements.","[10497, 10498]","[16455, 16456, 118686, 210626, 213841]","[8836, 44656, 44657]",78,1,[1],"[12, 31]",[2],86.55851776,290,"[1, 17, 21, 22, 38]",82.27925888,291,"[3189, 3190, 6650]",463,,,129,,,,[134],,,,,[53073],,,,,"[127875, 148227]",,

It was released in Japan on August 26, 2010. The word airou (アイルー airū) is the Japanese equivalent of felyne, a fictional sapient cat species that appears in all of the Monster Hunter games. The player gives orders to the felynes to progress to the end of quests instead of having direct control over them. The game also uses a much more cartoonish art style as opposed to the realism seen in other Monster Hunter games. More emphasis is placed on style and village management. A few Hello Kitty items are also available in the game. 
 
Monster Hunter Diary Poka Poka Airou Village G is an expansion pack and was released on August 10, 2011 in Japan. 
 
Monster Hunter Diary Giri Giri Airou Village is a series of ten television shorts developed to help advertise Poka Poka Airou Village. They feature felynes attempting quests and almost invariably failing at them. One episode also has a Chibiterasu cameo.

They set out on adventures through the world's past and learn about its history. Upon discovering different lands in the past and solving the troubles, they reappear in the game's present-day map.

The party begins their adventure when the hero and Kiefer discover a mysterious fragment of a map that the former's father brings home from a fishing trip. Further investigations lead the hero to discover that the world he lives on, which seems to consist of only his small island, used to contain many continents that have somehow been sealed away. By placing other stone fragments found throughout the journey on pedestals in Estard's ruins, the Hero and his friends are sent to different lands in the past which the party eventually realizes. Once they solve the problems in the area's past, the landmasses appear in the present.

After the world is restored, Orgodemir, the Demonlord, disguises himself as the Almighty and seals several of the islands away once again; this time Estard is sealed as well. The party sets out to revive the elemental spirits: Wind; Fire; Earth; and Water. Orgodemir is then revealed as the Demonlord to the world whereupon he claims to have done so to trick humanity. Orgodemir then raises the Cathedral of Blight; and with the aid of the Skystone, the party confronts him in a final battle.","Travel to the past to save the present in this classic Dragon Quest adventure that has been completely remade from the ground up for Nintendo 3DS.

She was betrayed by the one person she cared for the most, Rev James Beaumont. Little did he know the terror he was about to unleash upon the small town of Shady Hollow.

It wouldn’t be until the 1940’s before the Beaumont family would return to Shady Hollow. Cliff and Linda Beaumont along with their children Sally and John moved to Shady Hollow to open a coal mining operation. The woods outside of Shady Hollow were known to be rich with coal, and being in the coal business, the Beaumonts’ saw this as a great opportunity.

Several months after their arrival, their daughter Sally went missing. For weeks, the towns people searched the woods and the coal mines but all they would find is a shoe belonging to Sally by the Hollow Creek. Most believed that Sally must have fallen into the creek and drowned while others believed it was the curse of The Hollow Creek Witch.

A year later, both Cliff and Linda Beaumont grew ill and soon died. It was rumored that the loss of their daughter was too much for them to handle. John, being the sole remaining member of the Beaumont family was taken to an orphanage.

About thirty five years later (1975), John, now a grown man was approached by another mining company looking to buy the rights to the Beaumont Coal Company. The coal company was abandoned after the death of his parents so John agreed to sell his share of the company. On the morning of March 15th, 1975, John and two miners would travel through the woods to take mineral samples at one of the more lucrative mining sites in Shady Hollow. John would be the only person to return from that trip.

After several searches, the two miners were found. What the police saw would haunt them the rest of their lives. John Beaumont was immediately arrested for the murders and spent his remaining days in the Shady Hollow Mental Hospital.

In the spring of 2015, 5 indie film makers travel to Shady Hollow to do a documentary about the disappearance of the two miners in 1975 and the Beaumont family. After arriving, they soon find out that the townspeople of Shady Hollow don’t welcome outsiders and are resistant to speak about the troubled past of the town. They soon begin to uncover the urban legend of the Hollow Creek Witch that haunts the woods surrounding Shady Hollow.","A Haunting : Witching Hour is a storytelling Virtual Reality game of dark horror and desperate survival. An immersive experience finds players discovering – and taking part in – a rich story that explores the dark corners of human nature. It will unfold in episodes, giving players the opportunity to continue to unravel a complex mystery through downloadable content that picks up where the previous episode’s cliffhanger left off.

It is scheduled for release on both PC and console platforms.

Episode One follows an indie film crew who travels to Shady Hollow to produce a documentary on John Beaumont and the disappearance of the 2 miners. In 1975 John was accused and convicted of murdering two coal miners. During the investigation, John claimed it was the Hollow Creek Witch responsible for the disappearance of the miners.

Players take on the role of Eddie, a character with a checkered past who has psychic abilities that allows him to see things from the past while touching items found throughout the game. The game will start off with Eddie being found along a lonely road by police. The police bring Eddie in for questioning in regards to the whereabouts of the remaining film makers.

Gameplay 
In the game, the player assumes the role of Rascal armed with the Bubble Gun, in a mission through five worlds involving a medieval castle, ancient Aztec ruins, the aquatic city of Atlantis, a pirate ship and a Western town.[1] Each world has three forms: past, present, and future[1] (e.g. Castle Hackalott appears as a medieval castle in the past where in the present day, it has become a museum). 
 
The player needs only to complete the past level to gain access to the next world. In each past and present level, the player has to find the six pieces of the Time Clock in order to access the Time Bubble at the end and be able to access the next form of that world. Each future level has a boss fight against Chronon. Defeating him in all five gives access to the final world. The Bubble Gun has limited ammo, and which bubbles it shoots depends on how much ammo is left.",[24115],[97430],[23855],,,,[8],[2],,,[1],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In Soul Reaver 2, Kain saved Raziel's life by drawing the Soul Reaver from him - Raziel was meant to enter the blade and become its soul-devouring spectral half. This causes a paradox that changes time for the worse, and separates Kain and Raziel. 
 
Kain's part of the game follows him seeking Moebius the Time Streamer, a time traveling mystic for answers to where Raziel is, how he has changed time, and later following a lead Moebius gives him to explore a Vampire citadel. During his quest, Kain finds and completes a broken talisman of Vampire construct known as the Balance Emblem. Kain discovers murals during his quest dictating an ancient war between the first races to inhabit Nosgoth, the Ancient vampires and the Hylden. After sealing the Hylden in an alternate dimension using the Pillars of Nosgoth, the Hylden cursed the Ancients with blood-thirst, sterility and immortality, turning them into the first Vampires. Kain discovers from the murals that it was prophesied that both races would have a champion arise - a Vampire champion wielding the Soul Reaver, and a Hylden champion wielding a flaming sword. Because he possesses the material Soul Reaver depicted, Kain comes to believe he is the prophesied Vampire champion. The outcome of the battle between the two champions remains ambiguous.","Swords, sorcery, souls, and buckets of blood await you in Legacy of Kain: Defiance. Return to the corrupt world of Nosgoth, where the disfigured wraith Raziel pursues his creator, the vampire overlord Kain. Separated by their common enemies and time itself, the two anti-heroes must wage their own personal battles to discover what lies behind their destinies and defeat the vicious forces that seek to condemn their world to eternal damnation. While their foes plot and scheme, Kain and Raziel embark on a dark and twisted odyssey. In the end, only one of them may be left standing.

The game features only a portion of Los Angeles, using a slightly-modified version of the L.A. map from Midnight Club II. Making up for this, the game features another playable city, Tokyo, which uses the same map from Midnight Club 3: DUB Edition Remix. 
 
Unlike the console version, the police do not chase the player in ""Cruise"" mode. However, the player can get caught after running from the police for a long period of time, and eventually getting boxed in, and getting no fine. Also unlike the console version, Midnight Club: L.A. Remix does not feature cutscenes. Also, the cars in the game have been split up meaning that one half of the cars can be used in Los Angeles while the other half can be used in Tokyo, the bikes aren't split as all three can be used in Los Angeles and Tokyo.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,7071,,,,,,,,,,,,,

So do we turn our grief to joy as we send off the dead.

Awakened by the End of Days, Death, the most feared of the legendary Four Horsemen, embarks upon a quest to restore mankind, and redeem his brother's name. Along the way, the Horseman discovers that there are far worse things than an earthly Apocalypse, and that an ancient grudge may threaten all of Creation.

Darksiders II follows the exploits of Death, one of the four horsemen of the Apocalypse, in an action-packed tale that runs parallel to the events in the original Darksiders game. This epic journey propels Death across an expansive gameworld as he tries to redeem his brother, War, the horseman blamed for prematurely starting the Apocalypse in Darksiders.

Like the original Darksiders game before it, the second iteration of the series is primarily a hack 'n slash adventure. The game takes place across netherworld environments, including 'The White city', an outpost where angels live, and 'The Eternal Throne', a floating fortress where the Lords of the Dead stand guard over souls that need to be cleansed. Although Death is the most feared of the Four Horsemen, his physical abilities are very different than his brother, War. Death is far more nimble, and relies on a combination of melee and ranged attacks. In combat Death's primary weapon is his huge iconic scythe, with a wide range of other weapons and usable items that must be gathered as the game progresses. Weapons can be dual-wielded, upgradable armor can be acquired for protection and Death has access to his terrifying and powerful mount, Despair.",[19228],"[36100, 78727, 78728, 78729, 78730, 78731, 78732, 118672, 128778]",[28245],74.91666667,13,"[1, 2]","[9, 12, 25, 31]",[2],74.99183377,51,"[1, 17, 38]",74.95425022,64,[56574],280,,[8979],34,,,1269,[225],[7339],,,,"[28408, 155255]",,,,,,,

DEVELOPMENT HISTORY 
Marketing specifically requested a children's educational game for the Intellivoice. Programmer Ron Surratt (Atari 2600 BurgerTime) and graphic artist Peggi Decarli (USCF Chess) drew up some initial concepts for the game (Ron's input was requested because he used to be a teacher), then Steve Ettinger was assigned as programmer. New-hire Joe Ferreira was added to train with Peggi as a graphics artist. Steve and Joe quickly became a strong design team, taking the concept from a barnyard to a carousel and making the game their own. By the time it was finished, however, Marketing decided that sales of Intellivoice units were too low to support such a ""specialty"" cartridge. Magic Carousel was shelved with the hope that a future increase in Intellivoice sales would justify the game's release. It never happened. 
 
Steve and Joe had proved themselves to be a formidable team, so they were chosen to design the top-secret experimental Intellivision game, Hover Force 3-D.

But because of the dark thoughts in people's minds, the Nightmare was born and threatened to end the world. A brave sage appeared and, by using the Holy Instruments and the Dream Stone, sealed the Nightmare away into the holy land. Peace was restored but the world is now separated into the real world and dream world.

Years later, people forgot what has happened, and only recalled the events as a legend. Many have also heard about the Dream Stone sealed within the Temple of Dreams. Enter our hero, Rumble, a Ruinseeker (a high ranked treasure hunter) who wish to find the Dream Stone. At the same time, in the Dreamworld, a Baku (a weird looking animal that lives in the Dreamworld) who Rumble later names Tumble accidentally drops the box which holds 7 keys to the seal of the Temple. The keys went and hid in different people's dreams. To retrieve them, one must enter the dream and seek out the keys. Tumble can enter the dreams but there are many monsters within dreams and puzzles that he may need help with. Rumble realize he must get the keys in order to find the Dream Stone. Seeing that the two can help meet each other's goals, Rumble and Tumble decides to work together.

In Dual Hearts, Rumble and Tumble will travel around Sonno Island, meeting the people there and seek out those whose dreams holds one of the seven keys. Each dream is different as each person is different, which means that the enemies and puzzles Rumble will encounter will be different in each dream he visits. Within the dreamworld, everything is filled with gold and gems - even the boss is a giant money bag.

Within the dreams, Rumble will be able to use the Holy Instruments (in the form of a spear and sword) to fight enemies there. Rumble can use both weapons at the same time enabling him to do a variety of combo attacks. Tumble will help Rumble by carrying him on his back, enabling him to reach higher planes. He can also perform different attacks like the Breath Attack.

In order to advance, there are a variety of puzzles for our heroes to solve. For example, in one puzzle, you will be presented with movable blocks, several switches and a closed door. You must figure out which switch will open the door and move the block on the switch. If you run into any problems, you can always talk to Tumble or the Dream Sheep for hints and help.",,[223864],[18708],,,,[31],,,,[1],,,[73320],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Deus is a closed town built upon gigantic metal pillars - Columnae. Beneath them, a huge underground machine, called Machina, was constructed with the purpose of automatically extracting and processing resources and sending them via pipes through Columnae and into Deus. The society now living inside the columns settled there in an attempt to escape the lethal environment on the surface after Deus was locked down. Since then, they had no contact with the inhabitants of Deus, and they are parasitizing on the resources coming through the columns.

The game is divided into eight chapters, but the order of playing them is not chronological.

Each ship is designed to meet specialized standards so that no matter how young or old you are you can enjoy them just the same.

Most PixelShips are only a foot or two long and are flown using special devices called PICCs, or PixelShip Interface Command Consoles. The consoles have two joysticks and six buttons on each stick and can interface with any ship that has been registered into it. Some PICCs also have LCD displays so that you don't need a TV to see what your PixelShip sees while it flies.

Each PixelShip uses batteries, just like any other toy, though some use Micro-Reactors instead and are fueled at special facilities so that childeren cannot actually access the fuel inside. They are also designed out of segments held together by micro-magnets. When the ship is ""destroyed"" in combat, its micro-magnets disengage and the ship flies apart into its seperate segments, each still carrying a residual charge from the ship's anti-gravity unit. If all of the segments are then tagged by another PixelShip, that collector may then, under official guidelines, possess the ship if he so desires.

Your task is to collect all 160 known PixelShips by earning them through campaign battles at the arena. Afterwards, you will be given access to a special campaign where you may earn this unique and unheard of PixelShip.",PixelShips is a side-scrolling 2D shooter consisting of randomly generated levels and missions.,,,,,,,,,,,"[1, 18]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Part desktop simulator, part platformer, this is a game designed in 2.5 months for #PixelHorrorJam by myself & James_T_Ripper 
 
Inspired by the popular titles Welcome To The Game & Pony Island, File requires the mouse to be controlled in order to maneuver Raven's computer in search of a set of programs, each more horrifying as you progress. 
 
Controls: 
-Once a program is executed, the D/Right-Arrow Keys can be used to move the player right 
-Alternatively, the A/Left-Arrow Keys can be used to move the player left

Her only escape is her sketchbook and paintings in which she draws and paints to deal with life challenges. She is struggling to find inner peace with what has happened through her life. Her paintings of life changing incidents are both drawn from logical perspective of Mr. Ruppel or the chaotic view of Ms. Schmidt and you have to help her find the balance between these ever-conflicting feelings. Each scene and level tells a part of Lona's life story and the way she tries to deal with real life difficulties. You have to solve puzzles and use items important to her to try and bring her peace of mind.

Lona's story will be narrated in a non linear fashion with no dialogues and conventional narration methods. Instead you have to piece together all the clues given through levels, puzzles and an insane symphony of visual arts. This is our way of narrating a story of extreme emotions, one's inner conflicts and fighting to win against hardships of real life via a unique story telling medium called video game!""","""Take the brush as Lona, a young girl on a journey to the deepest depths of herself. Beware though! For in the realm of colors the craving to explore can turn to a yearning to return in a blink of an eye.

Lona - Realm of Colors is an independent puzzle-adventure dwelling in the highly stylized and abstract past memories of Lona.

Gates were one-way trips to random destinations, often taking one far across the galaxy. No-one knew a new gate's ultimate destination until it was finished and the first journey undertaken. 
 
Gatestriders, a nomadic colony of humanity, took pride in gate travel and the discovery of new areas of space. When resource rich planets were discovered, they would send Reaper teams to terraform the planet and mine its wealth for fortune and glory. 
 
One such foray inadvertently led them into a region of space deemed forbidden by the reclusive, yet powerful, Enshigi. 
 
The retaliation was swift, and ruthless. Within a week the Gatestriders lost their homeworld, their star sent nova by the Enshigi. 
 
The shattered society took to finding a new home for themselves. It was during this search that they came across the planet Em-8ER. This was where they encountered the Tsi-Hu: sentient, shapeshifting aliens who command huge creatures, known as Kaiju, into battle. This was how the war started.","What is EM-8ER? (pronounced Ember): 
 
EM-8ER is a multiplayer, open world, co-op shooter that pits players against a ruthless, shape-shifting, alien army called the Tsi-Hu. The game is a simulated war where massive battles ebb and flow across the planets surface. Hundreds of players will be fighting at any given time in skirmishes involving mechs, giant monsters, and military bases. EM-8ER combines high action, 1st and 3rd person shooting with crafting and RTS-like elements in a vast open world. We call this genre: Massive Planetary Wargame.","[45549, 45550, 45551, 45552]","[11915, 99566, 99567, 155614, 155615]",,,,"[2, 5]","[5, 32]","[1, 2]",,,"[1, 18, 38]",,,[23778],,,"[6443, 6444]",1,,,,[439],,,4,,,,,,,,,

FreeCell is a solitaire-based card game played with a 52-card standard deck. It is fundamentally different from most solitaire games in that nearly all deals can be solved. Although software implementations vary, most versions label the hands with a number (derived from the random number seed used to generate the hand).

Rules

Construction and layout:

* One standard 52-card deck is used.
* There are four open cells and four open foundations. Some alternate rules use between one to ten cells.
* Cards are dealt into eight cascades, four of which comprise seven cards and four of which comprise six. Some alternate rules will use between four to ten cascades.

Building during play:

* The top card of each cascade begins a tableau.
* Tableaux must be built down by alternating colors.
* Foundations are built up by suit.

Moves:

* Any cell card or top card of any cascade may be moved to build on a tableau, or moved to an empty cell, an empty cascade, or its foundation.
* Complete or partial tableaus may be moved to build on existing tableaus, or moved to empty cascades, by recursively placing and removing cards through intermediate locations. While computer implementations often show this motion, players using physical decks typically move the tableau at once.

Victory:

* The game is won after all cards are moved to their foundation piles.

For games with the standard layout (four open cells and eight cascades) most games are easily solved.

Supported Operations:
* Tap one column and tap another column, move the cards from the first column to second column if possible;
* Double Tap on the column's last card to move it to buffer area, if possible;
* Drag cards from one column to another column, if possible;
* Auto throw, cards will be throw to recycle automatically, if possible;
* Drag from recycle to columns to restore the recycled card, if possible;

With Auto-throw, it is much more convenient to finish the card puzzle!
Enjoy it, players!",,[71846],,,,,,,70,0,,70,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When the solar explosions died, the humans decide to return to Earth. When the Kat Men refuse to leave, a war droid known as MT-ED, or Multi Terrain Exploration Droid, is sent down to deal with the Kat Men. Accompanying him is Hercules 1, a maintenance and combat droid. When the two droids are beamed down, things take a turn for the worse. Hercules is kidnapped and taken far away to the Kat Men's Nerve Center. It is MT-ED's task to get rid of the Kat Men and rescue Hercules. 
 
To do this, MT-ED has to explore fourteen environments and deal with deadly creatures that are within each environment, with each type of creature requiring a certain type of weapon to be defeated. These weapons - including lasers, water bombs, grenades, and rockets - can be picked up along the way, and MT-ED can switch between them with ease. If MT-ED comes into contact with any of the creatures, he is kicked into the air and gets stunned for a few seconds. If this happens, he loses one of his lives. Not all creatures are deadly; some of them will steal whatever weapons MT-ED is carrying at the time. 
 
Besides using weapons to kill, MT-ED also has the ability to jump over creatures that may be too slow for him to shoot. When MT-ED finally rescues Hercules, a sub-game needs to be completed. When MT-ED completed this sub-game, the Kat Men's Central Computer is disabled and the Kat Men go back where they came from.",,,,,,[1],[5],[4],,,"[1, 18]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Even if you haven't played Pillars of Eternity, now is a great time to jump in and experience the hardcore classic RPG with The White March - Part I. 
 
Main features 
-Raised level cap: Your party of six adventurers can now progress beyond level 12 to 14. The additional levels add powerful new spells, abilities and talents for all 11 classes. 
-New areas to explore: Largely focused on the snowy environments inspired by Icewind Dale, the expansion will feature a new quest hub, and many additional quests and dungeons. 
-Soulbound weapons: The expansion features mighty artifacts that grow stronger over time. These weapons gain different powers and attributes depending on the character class that binds to it. 
-New companions: Part 1 of the expansion introduces two new companions you will be able to use throughout all of your adventures. The Devil of Caroc, a rogue, and Zahua, a monk, will be available to join you on your quest in The White March and will travel back with you into the base game. 
-Multi-class talents: Classes will now have additional options to diversify and take on some of the abilities of other classes. 
-Party AI: Now you will have the option to set AI scripts for your party, allowing you to focus on controlling the characters you care about most. 
-Enhanced Enemy AI: Enemies and monsters are now smarter than ever. The new AI makes the entire game more of a challenge, and spell casters will use a wider variety of their spells in more devastating ways. 
-Respec: At any inn or tavern the player can re-level their party members. It gives flexibility for the player to experiment with the RPG systems and try out builds with the newly added multi-class talents. If you aren't completely satisfied with your character, you can now do a rebuild and start over fresh.",[6319],"[57280, 57281, 119392]",,70,2,[1],[12],[3],80.14679962,9,[17],75.07339981,11,[9811],2599,,,5,,[1111],1593,[13],,,,,"[38780, 75357]",,,,,,,

Michael Jakobsen’s puzzle-platformer, centred around a castle, requires players to find five hidden crystals and return them to their rightful place. Outside of the castle there are outside areas (including a wasteland, a pyramid, a sea and an island). 
 
Upon returning the crystals, the player must teleport to a separate set of locations to complete the game. Once the game is completed, the player is left free to roam the castle in order to achieve the maximum possible score if they have not done so already. The only way to see the final congratulatory message is to reach 99 points. 
 
Citadel was unusual at the time for playing synthesized speech before loading the main game (in part to advertise Superior Software's ""Speech!"" programme package), as well as having other special effects advanced for the time, such as splashing water sounds. Many BBC Micro gamers regard Citadel as a seminal game and it has spawned social media appreciation pages.","[34447, 34448]",[137263],,,,[1],"[8, 31]",[4],,,"[1, 17]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The gameplay has the player navigating the character through a point and click adventure. Navigate against pre-rendered backgrounds and pick up items to use later. Consult the automatically drawn map for directions. Many of the rooms in the game also contain some type of minigame necessary to advance the overall game. Minigames include reassembling suits of knight armor from a mess of pieces; quickly lighting a sequence of torches; guiding a group of frogs off a fountain via circling lily pads; and protecting a moth from a gang of hungry spiders.

The world is driven to chaos when a mysterious tower suddenly appears. In the tower resides “The End,” a person who threatens to destroy the world. To stop him, SEALED, a special forces unit of psychics, is created. 
 
You are a member of SEALED and the newly minted leader of a group tasked with scaling the tower and stopping The End. Create a team strategy and synergize your 11 team members’ abilities to get past the enemies of the tower! In addition to fighting, remember to develop bonds in between battles, as that is key to finding the traitor in your midst. Once you reach the Judgement phase, you’ll be forced to eliminate your enemies (or allies!) on each floor until you reach the top. Each playthrough will have different results, so don’t get too attached to anyone.
